# Wireshark – Network Attack Detection Project

## Objective
To simulate and detect network-based attacks using Wireshark in a SOC-style environment.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Kali Linux
- VirtualBox

## Attack Simulated
- TCP SYN Port Scan (Nmap)

## Methodology
1. Captured live network traffic
2. Applied protocol-based filters
3. Identified suspicious SYN packets
4. Analyzed packet headers
5. Validated attack using TCP conversation statistics
6. Documented findings in an incident report

## Evidence
Screenshots and PCAP files are included.

## Outcome
Successfully detected and analyzed a port scanning attack and documented the incident following SOC best practices.
